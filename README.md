This is a super easy to use Bitcoin nova miner front end that is better than the official beginner miner in that it allows you to mine from a variety of different pools and custom pools, as well as allowing for more configurations.

It is also better than a command-line only miner or pre-configured miner in that it has automatic error correction, directly reports pool fees and payouts within the miner window, and does not force you to use a specific miner or pool.

To use it, just start ‘BitcoinNova-Miner.exe’ from your zip folder, extract it all, enter your address and start mining!

Features:

* Supports 5 miners out of the box with no configuration necessary.
* Allows more config than the beginner miner.
* Tells you a pool’s minimum payout and fees within the miner.
* Notifies you of any errors in your config and tries to correct them.
* Auto-tune feature that automatically tunes and fixes your configuration.
* Saves your last configuration as .bat and .config files if you want to launch the miners directly.
* Let’s you pick a custom pool.
* Has a built in helpdesk if you are having trouble.
* Easily check your earned BTN at the click of a button.
* Run multiple miners at once and manage them from just one window!
* Save and load different configurations for different gpus or pools. no need to re-enter info!
* OPTIONAL Automatic updating notifications, so you don't need to keep checking for new updates here.
